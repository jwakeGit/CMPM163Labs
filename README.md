Cube 1 (Crimson): This cube was made with Three.js materials. I changed the color of this cube to crimson, and added a red specular value, along with increased shine.
Cube 2 (Turquoise and Red): This cube was built with my shaders, and I chose the colors turquoise and red for its interpolation.
Cube 3 (Default): This cube was made with Three.js materials. This cube was not changed from how it started (as intended by the lab instructions.)
Cube 4 (Blue and Green): This cube was built with my shaders, and I chose the colors blue and green for its interpolation.

lab 4:
a. The formula would be x = u*7
